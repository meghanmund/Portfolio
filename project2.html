        <p>
          This is a solo project that spanned from April into May of 2023, as it
          included initial app and audience research, creating wireframes, as
          well as constructing a pitch-deck and support website to accompany the
          eventual interactive prototype. I initially wanted to design an app
          for the Bay Area Climbers Coalition. After checking their website, I
          found it was really lacking in events and community involvement. I
          thought to myself, “Well, what if the community ran their own events?”
          And BACC Community started coming together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to predict what the person using this app would be like, and I
          also interviewed a few climbers around my gym. I wanted to create
          something playful and energetic. I put a lot of work into creating
          interactions and animations that were nods to the climbing community,
          such as the spilled chalk bag for the “pardon our dust!” message. I
          really had a riot making this project and I hope my passion comes
          through.
