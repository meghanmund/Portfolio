        I've really started getting comfortable using Adobe Illustrator as of
        October 2023 and I like to think it shows. So, when my brother reached
        out to me to help in designing a logo for his psych practice, I was
        elated. Here was an opportunity to show off my skills while also helping
        my brother build his brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked at what other practices in the area were doing, as well as
        referenced many other psychology medical logos. I decided that a sans
        serif font that has a serif “g” was a nice touch. For the color scheme,
        I went the opposite way I do with most of my projects: simple, calming,
        clinical navy blue. But, not too clinical! That's why I went for a warm
        white.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my symbols, I wanted personal touches in addition to broad
        representations - a lot of psych logos include a silhouetted face or a
        brain or things of that nature. I wanted to make sure I represented the
        area, as I know my brother loves living in Colorado. I included a
        silhouette of Indian Peaks, a range visible from Arvada where his office
        is located.
