            I've really started getting comfortable using Adobe Illustrator as of October 2023 and I like to think it shows. So, when my brother reached out to me to help in designing a logo for his psych practice, I was elated. Here was an opportunity to show off my skills while also helping my brother build his brand. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I looked at what other practices in the area were doing, as well as referenced many other psychology medical logos. I decided that a sans serif font that has a serif “g” was a nice touch. For the color scheme, I went the opposite way I do with most of my projects: simple, calming, clinical navy blue. But, not too clinical! That's why I went for a warm white. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For my symbols, I wanted personal touches in addition to broad representations - a lot of psych logos include a silhouetted face or a brain or things of that nature. I wanted to make sure I represented the area, as I know my brother loves living in Colorado. I included a silhouette of Indian Peaks, a range visible from Arvada where his office is located.
